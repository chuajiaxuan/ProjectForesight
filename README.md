# Story
A technological breakthrough in the top secret laboratory of the U.S. Military has made it possible to augment human vision. Through this technology, called Omni-Sight, humans are powered to view in three additional visions, namely night, thermal, and X-Ray, on top of their normal day-to-day vision. The U.S. Military devised a secret project (codename Project Foresight), to recruit test subjects, called Visionaires, to experiment on this technology. They are planted in abandoned facilities for the experiment. You as the Visionaire, will have to figure out how to utilize your visions to solve puzzles and escape the facility while being pursued by a human killer, known as The Fallen One, who is a failed test subject of Project Foresight.
