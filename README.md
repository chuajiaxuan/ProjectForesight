## Description
Foresight is a survival escape room game that leverages on VR through a unique mechanic which allows the player to have night and thermal vision on top of normal vision. There will also be puzzles that are built into the environment that specifically uses the different visions. The player plays as the protagonist John Wakefield, who wakes up in an abandoned facility. Soon he realised that he has the ability to switch between three visions! In addition, he encounters a dark presence nearby that is out to kill him... 

## Story
A technological breakthrough in the top secret laboratory of the U.S. Military has made it possible to augment human vision. Through this technology, called Omni-Sight, humans are powered to view in three additional visions, namely night and thermal visions on top of their normal day-to-day vision. The U.S. Military devised a secret project (codename Project Foresight), to recruit test subjects, called Visionaires, to experiment on this technology. They are planted in abandoned facilities for the experiment. You as the Visionaire, will have to figure out how to utilize your visions to solve puzzles and escape the facility while being pursued by a human killer, known as The Fallen One, who is a failed test subject of Project Foresight.
